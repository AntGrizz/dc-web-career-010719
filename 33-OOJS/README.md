# Object Oriented Javascript
- Javascript Under the hood
- ES5
- ES6

## Why object oriented programming?
- code re-use (dry)
- readability
- group data and functionality
- storage/db 

greet(person)
person.greet()

## Object Creation Patterns
- literal
 - {}
- Factory pattern
- `new` Object

## `new` and constructor calls
- properties
- methods

## Prototype Chain, and `__proto__`
- .__proto__ property of an object, points to that object's parent's prototype object

## Parts of a Class
- Attributes (instance variables)
- Class variables
- Methods (call some function associated with the object)
  - Instance methods - behavior of one of these kinds of objects
  - Class methods - behavior associated with the whole class

## `class` syntax
- They are not hoisted

## Object inheritance and Object relationships
