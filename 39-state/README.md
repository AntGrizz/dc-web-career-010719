## State
- Change over time
- State is similar to props, but it is private and fully managed by the class component (can't be functional)
- Set up the state object using this.state in the constructor
- or outside the constructor

## Virtual DOM
- App is re-rendered when there is a change in state or props

## Conditional Rendering?
- Don't modify state directly, use this.setState({})
  - works asynchronously
- When does the DOM get re-rendered?

## Controlled Forms and Event Callback handlers

## On Your Own
- practice working with other input types (textarea, select, checkbox, radio button)
- https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html
